Configuration.h and configuration files
These are setup for use with Anet A8 and a Tronxy XY-08N auto home sensor/probe that is mounted to the front left side of the extruder frame.
I offer no support, warranty, garuntee implied or expressed in any way shape or form, it is upto you the end user to verify that these files will work for you.
You are welcome to modify these anyway you see fit to suit your needs and upload/share them anywhere indeffinantly.

Please do your research, as if you have a z axis limit switch still and don't have a auto home sensor/probe you will have to
undefine the fixed mounted probe statement in the configuration.h file via arudino 1.8.5.
